This is a repository where we are going to implement 6 projects with few bonus application. We will use different API-KEY through different models. We are gonna need few libraries and frameworks for developing these end to end applications.
Some libraries needed to be installed through the 'pip'. All the libraries that needed to be installed are typed into a text called 'requirements.txt'.

>> You just open your VSCODE's Command Prompt Termina terminal and type
>> pip install -r requirements.txt

*******Good Luck*******
